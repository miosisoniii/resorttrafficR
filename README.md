# resorttrafficR

As a wedding photographer who LOVES skiing ‚õ∑Ô∏è but HATES traffic, I wanted to condense all of the traffic times that it takes to get to ski resorts in Colorado instead of entering each of them manually on my phone. This app is really helpful to me because I have both Ikon and Epic passes, with my primary location based in Denver. I have double the ski resorts to decide to go to, and it may even be helpful to the future couples that I work with when choosing a ski resort to photograph them in.

This R Shiny application uses the GoogleMaps API. 


## Future Plans üó∫Ô∏è

- [ ]Inclusion of a map üó∫Ô∏è from the GoogleMaps API
- [x] Table format instead of a dropdown menu to make it even faster to select which resort to head to.
- [ ] Weather forecast API integration
- [ ] Snow report API integration
